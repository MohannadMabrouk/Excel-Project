# Excel-Project
Excel Project that shows some useful insights about the bike sales data based on the income.
Here are some of the insights in the dashboard:
- Firstly I made some preprocessing and cleaning on the data then i started to extract some insights and then make pivot tables and visuals.
- I created some slicers. Slicers are visual filters that allow you to easily select and filter the data in a pivot table.

- The dashboard shows the average income per customer and the correlation of buying a bike.
- The dashboard shows the sales by gender.
- The dashboard shows the customer's commute distance and how it affects the bike purchase.
